- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m @blkdigiarchivist
- 👀 I’m interested in a little bit of everything, specifically how to apply my library science and information degree to use outside of the library.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, NoSQL, Python, R, DbBrowser, and other relevant scripting languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on digital preservation of born-digital materials, digital forensics for libraries, and creating complex workflows.
